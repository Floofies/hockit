  DESCRIPTION
  -----------
HockIt is super-simple file sharing server software written in NodeJS; you can use it via the CLI in a Terminal, HTTP in a web browser, the REST API, or a standard I/O interface.
Hockit implements a traditional REST API via the Get and Post HTTP request methods; response bodies are in JSON format, and are sometimes omitted in favor of HTTP status codes.
To access the REST API, you must supply a valid token in the  Authorization  HTTP request header. API tokens can be generated/revoked via CLI, see  API Token Commands .
